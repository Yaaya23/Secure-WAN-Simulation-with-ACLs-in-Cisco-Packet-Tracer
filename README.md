# Secure-WAN-Simulation-with-ACLs-in-Cisco-Packet-Tracer
🔐 This project demonstrates how to build a secure Wide Area Network (WAN) using Cisco Packet Tracer. 

## 🧱 Project Overview
- Simulates communication between Ghana and Cape Verde branch offices
- CIDR-based IP addressing scheme
- Access Control Lists (ACLs) to allow only HTTP and ICMP traffic
- Ensures restricted, secure communication between endpoints

Devices: - 2 Routers (1 per branch) 
- 2 Switches (1 per branch)  
- 8 PCs (4 per branch)
- 1 Server for the Ghana office used to establish http connection with the Cape Verde Office
   
IP Addressing: - Ghana LAN: 192.168.0.0/29 
-Cape Verde LAN: 192.168.0.8/29 
WAN Link: 192.168.1.0/30 
Security: - ACLs allow only HTTP (port 80) and ICMP (ping) - All other traffic is denied 
Testing: - Verified connectivity with ping and web browser

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Cisco Packet Tracer
- Networking concepts: CIDR, ACLs, Static Routing
