# Secure-WAN-Simulation-with-ACLs-in-Cisco-Packet-Tracer
🔐 This project demonstrates how to build a secure Wide Area Network (WAN) using Cisco Packet Tracer.

## 🧱 Project Overview

- Simulates communication between Ghana and Cape Verde branch offices
- CIDR-based IP addressing scheme
- Access Control Lists (ACLs) to allow only HTTP and ICMP traffic
- Ensures restricted, secure communication between endpoints

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Cisco Packet Tracer
- Networking concepts: CIDR, ACLs, Static Routing
